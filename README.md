# Interface Corona Task

This HTML file implements a simple interface for managing COVID-19 related tasks. It allows users to input names and add them to two lists: "Enregistrees" and "Vaccinees." Each entry in the "Enregistrees" list includes a button to mark it as vaccinated and move it to the "Vaccinees" list. The user can also remove entries using the "Ã—" button.
## Note

- Make sure to add both the name and surname when adding a person to the list.
- Deleting an entry from either list is permanent.
